<h4>1. Trump's Lies</h4>
    <p>
        Scraping a table of all the lies Trump has told since his inauguration from [this NYTime article](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/06/23/opinion/trumps-lies.html). I watched [Kevin from DataSchool's tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_xb0vF1uMc&list=PL5-da3qGB5IDbOi0g5WFh1YPDNzXw4LNL) on YouTube before working on this. 
        
        Kevin is one of my favorite instructors. When he explains a concept, he breaks down each part of the script so you not only know how to write the code but also understand where everything is coming from! He gives great tips too!
